    <h1>WHY DOG IS MY FAVOURITE ANIMAL</h1>
    <p style="text-align: start;">There are many reasons to love dogs, <br>
        from their loyalty and companionship to their positive impact on
        <br>
        your mental and physical health.
        <br>
        Dogs are often called "man's best friend,"
        and are cherished for their loyalty, companionship, and playful nature.
        <br>
        They come in many breeds, each with a unique personality, and can be trained to perform various tasks.

                <h2>Constant Companionship:</h2>
            </li>
            <p><br>Having a dog means you are never truly alone.
                <br>They will follow you from room to room, sit by your side when you are sad,
                <br>
                and eagerly join in on any activity.

                <h2>Feeling of Security:</h2>
            </li>
            <p>A dog's natural protective instincts provide a sense of safety.
                <br>
                Even a small dog can alert you to a stranger's presence,
                <br>
                and a larger dog can be a deterrent to intruders.

                <br>
                They don't care if you're having a bad day, or what you look like;
                <br>
                they are just happy to be with you.
